Van Patten Media Security Keys
==============================

This repository contains PGP/GPG keys for contacting Van Patten Media about security issues. In lieu of the newly established keys having been signed by others to prove their validity, you can have a reasonable degree of confidence that these are the correct keys on the assumptions that:

 * This is our `vanpattenmedia/security-keys` repository, and not somewhere else. This must not be a fork!
 * Only authorised Van Patten Media people have write access to this repository.
 * You are accessing GitHub securely, and have verified the authenticity of your connection to GitHub (it should be an EV SSL certificate, signed ultimately by DigiCert, then by the GTE CyberTrust Global Root).
 * You have taken a look at recent commits to see if this has been modified recently in an unusual way.
